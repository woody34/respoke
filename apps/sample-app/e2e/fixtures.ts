/**
 * Playwright fixtures for sample-app tests.
 *
 * KEY FIX: The @descope/react-sdk calls POST /v1/auth/try-refresh on init
 * with `credentials: 'include'`. In headless Chromium, cross-origin fetches
 * with credentials fail with net::ERR_FAILED before reaching the server
 * (browser CORS preflight → response → second fetch fails on credentials).
 *
 * Solution: intercept try-refresh via page.route() and proxy it through
 * Playwright's request API (which bypasses browser security restrictions).
 * This allows the emulator to validate the refresh token and return fresh
 * session JWTs, properly authenticating the SDK.
